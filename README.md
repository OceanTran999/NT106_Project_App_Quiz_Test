# How to run
1. First, you'll see "FormMoDau", which has "Admin(Server)" and "Sinh viên(Client)". Server must be log in first, so Clients can connect.
2. Server must create databases (database about Math, Physics, etc) for choosing subjects in ComboBox next to "Chọn đề" in "FormDieuLenh".
3. To send Client test or message use "ComboBox" in FormDieuLenh which has "Choose..."
4. Clients must fill their information in "FormDieuThongTin" and wait for Server sends the test.
5. After Clients do the test and submit (or exam time is over), both Server and Clients will know about Clients's score
